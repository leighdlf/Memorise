// View model. Glue/portal between model and view.
// Class instead of struct as many views will have pointers to it/use as portal.
// EmojiMemoryGame because its a type of MemoryGame that draws emojis
// Imports SwiftUI as instead of Foundation as it knows how things will be drawn.
// Don't call EmojiMemoryGame var model, use something like game instead.
// MemoryGame type is String as that what emojis are.
// private(set) allows others to see but only EmojiMemoryGame chan modify it. Don't want others being able to change the model.
// private(set) isn't used. Access to model is done. Allows Views to interpret data (maybe process it).
// Intents (like func choose()) allows views tell the model what it wants to do/happen?
