import SwiftUI

// EmojiMemoryGameView 'behaves' like a view. The rectangle of this view is the entire screen.
// View is a protocol. 'Constrains and gains'.
// var body is a property. some View type is any type that behaves like a view.
// Each some View can only contain the same type of view. ie some is singular.
// Think of views like legos. They can be put together. ZStack is a combiner view
// return isn't needed in one liners.
// Text also behaves like a view.
// Having modifiers on ZStack scopes it; applies to all.
// padding applies to entire ZStack, foregroundColor to its children.
// index is iteration var. ForEach isn't layout like ZStack.
// Padding and spacing(in stacks) is generally kept standard.
// if nor args then () can be removed, if last arg is {} cat sit outside.
// Like model, you wouldn't use viewModel as a name.
// viewModel is a pointer to the EmojiMemoryGame. It is created in the SceneDelegate file?

// Cant create var in view builder (eg HStack), can be put in the var body, or better as a computed value in the struct.
// @ObservedObject says a var has an observable object in it. SwiftUI is smart and will only redraw the what is required; card changed.
// @ObservedObject and @Published allows for reactive programming.

// ZStack is a view builder or from one?
