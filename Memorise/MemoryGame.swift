// This is the model. UI independent; doesn't know how the display works.
// strucs are always copied. arg to functions become constants.

import Foundation

// Nesting structs inside strucs is generally a name-spacing thing.
// CardContent is a 'don't care'. Whoever creates this needs to provide the content (eg EmojiGameModel).
// self. might eventually not be needed but safe to use it most of the time.
// var cards: Array<Card> is uninitialised, must be passed a value when the struct is.
// therefore in func choose we flip the cards flips the card directly in the array. In structs only mutating funcs can change self.
